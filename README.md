# deDOG: A Decentralized Experiment in Effort-Based Value and Fair Distribution

## Abstract
**deDOG** is an experiment in decentralization, exploring the creation and distribution of value based on effort rather than arbitrary allocation. The project introduces a meme coin distributed solely through work—specifically, the actions required to unlock tokens from immutable faucets on the Cardano blockchain. The experiment operates without pre-mining, governance mechanisms, or long-term central oversight. Its fate rests entirely in the hands of its participants, making it a symbol of collective action and effort.

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose
The purpose of **deDOG** is to test the hypothesis that value can emerge from collective belief and effort, without centralized direction or control. By creating a token distributed entirely through user-driven effort, **deDOG** challenges traditional notions of value and distribution.

### Core Principles
- **Effort-Based Value:** Tokens are earned through the work of interacting with immutable faucets, requiring users to incur transaction costs and meet specific conditions.
- **Fair Distribution:** The creator holds no pre-mined tokens and must mine alongside all other participants.
- **Decentralized Evolution:** The project’s narrative, governance, and future utility are shaped entirely by the community, without intervention from the creator.

## 2. The Faucets

### Design
**deDOG** tokens are locked in two Cardano validator addresses:
- **Noob Faucet:** Dispenses 100 tokens per qualifying transaction.
- **Expert Faucet:** Dispenses 1,000 tokens per qualifying transaction.

### Requirements to Unlock Tokens
To ensure fairness and effort-based value:
1. The user's wallet must not contain any **deDOG** tokens at the time of the transaction.
2. Users must meet other validation logic detailed in the public repository.

### Immutability
The faucet logic is immutable, guaranteeing that the rules cannot be altered after deployment.

## 3. Participation

### For Noobs
A self-hosted frontend, equipped with clear, text-based documentation, provides step-by-step instructions for:
- Setting up a wallet.
- Connecting to public Cardano nodes.
- Interacting with the faucets to unlock tokens.

### For Experts
Experts can interact directly with the validator contracts. The public GitHub repository contains:
- The validator scripts in raw form.
- Documentation for deploying custom integrations or modifications.

---

## 4. Technical Transparency

### Public Repository
All code, contracts, and documentation are hosted on a public GitHub repository, ensuring full transparency and auditability.

### Node Access
The frontend uses trusted public Cardano nodes by default, with configurable options for users who wish to connect to their own nodes.

### Decentralized Frontend
The frontend is designed to be self-hosted, empowering users to participate without relying on centralized infrastructure.

---

## 5. Governance
**deDOG** launches with no formal governance structures. Any attempts to establish governance or coordination mechanisms must arise organically from the community.

---

## 6. Educational Onboarding

### Noob Onboarding
Educational materials focus on simplicity, providing:
- Step-by-step guides for wallet creation.
- Instructions for using the self-hosted frontend.
- Details on faucet interaction.

### Expert Resources
Experts receive:
- Access to raw validator scripts.
- Advanced documentation for audit and extension.

---

## 7. Philosophy

### A Decentralized Story
**deDOG** carries no predefined message or mission beyond its existence as an experiment. Its narrative, symbolism, and value are left entirely to its participants. Whether it thrives, evolves, or fades into obscurity is a reflection of collective action and belief.

### No Creator Authority
The creator holds no authority after launch. Any tokens acquired will come through the same processes available to all participants.

### Organic Evolution
The project acknowledges that its direction may diverge from the creator’s initial vision. All outcomes are considered valid expressions of decentralization.

---

## 8. Conclusion
**deDOG** is more than a meme coin; it’s an exploration of effort, value, and community-driven evolution. By stepping back entirely after launch, the creator entrusts its future to the world. Whether it becomes a symbol of decentralization, a niche community experiment, or something entirely unexpected, **deDOG** is a testament to the possibilities of decentralized systems.
